❌ Bad Code:
```javascript
function sum(){ return a+b}
```

🔍 Issues:
* ❌ The variables `a` and `b` are not defined within the scope of the function, nor are they passed as arguments. This
will lead to errors when the function is executed because `a` and `b` will be treated as undefined.
* ❌ The function lacks input validation, which means it doesn't check if `a` and `b` are numbers, potentially leading to
unexpected results if non-numeric values are used.

✅ Recommended Fix:

```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
if (typeof a !== 'number' || typeof b !== 'number') {
return 'Invalid input: Both arguments must be numbers.';
}
return a + b;
}
```

💡 Improvements:
* ✔ Defines `a` and `b` as parameters to the function, allowing values to be passed in when the function is called.
* ✔ Includes input validation to ensure that both `a` and `b` are numbers. This helps prevent errors and makes the
function more robust.
* ✔ Returns an error message when the input is invalid, providing useful feedback to the user.
